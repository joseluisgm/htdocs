### Excellent Features of ProfilePress

= Custom Frontend Forms =

* **User Registration Forms** – Let users signup via a custom registration form.
* **Login & Password Reset Forms** – Allow users to log in and reset their passwords.
* **User Dashboard** – My Account page and edit profile forms for users to manage their profile details and account settings.

= User Profiles & Member Directories =

Add beautiful user profiles to your site that display the profile picture and information of your users. And create searchable and filterable member directories allowing users to find each other.

We also provide shortcodes to display users avatars and allow users to upload their profile pictures from the front-end of your site.

= Advanced and Drag-and-Drop Form Builder =

We took the pain out of creating user profiles, member directories, forms with our intuitive drag-and-drop builder.

We also provide an advanced form builder that gives you the flexibility to build any type of form. With knowledge of HTML, you code the form in combination with our expressive shortcodes, make it pretty with CSS and we handle the rest.

Never start from scratch again. ProfilePress comes with several beautiful, customizable pre-built templates for user profile, member directory and forms to help you save even more time.

ProfilePress gives you fine-grained control over what content your users can see based on your [protection rules](https://profilepress.net/article/adding-content-protection-rules/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion) and [shortcodes](https://profilepress.net/article/wordpress-content-restriction-shortcodes/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion). You can restrict content including pages, child pages, posts, custom post types, categories, tags and custom taxonomies based on their user roles, usernames, email address, and logged-in status.

ProfilePress also lets you:

* Disable the admin bar and restrict access to the WordPress dashboard based on user roles.
* Redirect the WordPress default login page (wp-login.php) to your custom login, registration page and password reset pages.
